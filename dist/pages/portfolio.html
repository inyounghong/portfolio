<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This version of my portfolio website was created in August 2017 and was built using AngularJS, ES6, SASS, Bootstrap, and Webpack. It is a complete design and code uplift from the previous version of my portfolio from 2016, which did not use ES6 or Webpack.</p>

<h3>2016</h3>
<p>In the previous version of my website, I had aimed to be very minimalistic. My background information was displayed in the landing page, and the only other page I had was for displaying my projects.</p>
