<p>In this project, we wished to explore the powers of genetic optimization upon different
structures. We originally chose to apply genetic optimization to chess AI, but that was too
computationally expensive to have time to evolve the AI to their full potential for examination. So
instead, this project applies genetic optimization to different forms of AI for the game of Othello,
which is a simpler game. We hoped to see that certain AI structures were more or less
conducive to genetic optimization. Of those that performed well, we also hoped to learn new
Othello strategies, and understand how the AI structure guided the genetic optimization to such
strategies. This project touches upon several AI topics including mini-max trees, genetic
optimization, and neural networks. It was written in Java.</p>
