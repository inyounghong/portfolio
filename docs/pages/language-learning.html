<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This Meteor.js application makes language learning easier by automating two key tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Looking up unknown words when reading a foreign text.</li>
    <li>Remembering and drilling words that are frequently looked-up.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this website, users can create an account and upload texts to read or browse other texts uploaded by others. Clicking on a word in a text sends an AJAX request to the Yandex translation API and displays a translation above to the word, allowing for a smooth and seamless reading experience. All translated words are recorded for the user to later review, edit with a custom translation, or delete. A flashcard function is provided to help users learn any words that haven't been marked as learned. </p>

<p>This project was a study in Meteor.js and database design, and was inspired by the difficulty of my university German class.</p>
