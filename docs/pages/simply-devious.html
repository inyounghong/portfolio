<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.simplydevio.us">SimplyDevio.us</a> is a website that allows users with no HTML/CSS knowledge to design and then purchase their own widgets and themes for DeviantART.com. Since the creation of this site in 2013, I have made almost $10,000 in sales.</p>

<p>SimplyDevio.us is my oldest web project, and also the one I have put the most time and effort into. This site began as a tentative exploration into web development and UI/UX, but it has since undergone countless iterations as I have gained more skills and improved on design.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Like with Tumblr or Wordpress, users on DeviantART are able to include CSS widgets their profile pages and apply skins to blogs entries (called Journals). However, prior to making this site available in 2014, there were only a handful of users across all of DeviantART who had been able to apply CSS widgets to their profile pages. This problem was two-fold: (1) Users lacked the necessary HTML/CSS knowledge to make these widgets, and (2) The process of applying these widgets to DeviantART was a complex process.</p>

<p>I had previously been taking commissions to manually create individualized widgets. However, I realized that I would save a significant amount of time (and also make a great deal of money) by making web applications that could do this task for me.</p>


<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Provide an easy process for DeviantART.com users to create personalized widgets for their profile page.</li>
    <li>Provide an easy-to-use interface for creating personalized journal skins. Users should have enough features to maximize customization, but not too many to become confusing or overwhelming.</li>
    <li>Allow users to login or otherwise save their themes and widgets for (a) easy modification in the future and (b) backup in case they lose their files -- something that was surprisingly common.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>This website grew in several stages of development as I gained more knowledge and experience in web technology.</p>

<h3>2013: HTML, CSS, Javascript</h3>
<p>I had been familiar with HTML/CSS when I began this site, but I learned Javascript while making my first application for this website, the Journal Skin Creator, which allows users to generate CSS styles for their DeviantART.com journals. The first iteration of this application was a basic Javascript form. When submitted, a preview of the skin opened in a new tab and the corresponding HTML/CSS code could be copied.</p>

<h3>2014-2015: jQuery, New Widgets, and Design</h3>
<p>Several new developments were made in 2014.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Many applications were developed for generating custom widgets for profile pages.</li>
    <li>Jquery was used instead of vanilla Javascript for grabbing form input, simplifying the code significantly.</li>
    <li>Forms were displayed as a series of tabs instead of as one long form.</li>
    <li>The form and the preview were displayed side-by-side and the preview reflected changes to the form in real-time for much improved usability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2016: SASS + New Design</h3>
<p>The developments in 2015 and 2016 focused on migrating to SASS</p>
<ul>
    <li>Organized the site's styling from a confusing mass of CSS to smaller, modularized SCSS files. </li>
    <li>Implemented new designs for forms to make the interface more appealing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2017: Migration to AngularJS</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Migrated most widgets to AngularJS to vastly simplify code and make it far easier to generate more widgets.</li>
</ul>
