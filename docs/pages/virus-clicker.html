<p>VirusClicker is a time-wasting clicking game inspired by the infamous <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a> game. The goal of the game is to infect as many people as possible, while also upgrading your virus to epic new levels.</p>

<p>Project was a quick study in AngularJS.</p>
